It offers flexibility in selecting the length of the password and choosing which types of characters to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). Additionally, it evaluates the strength of the generated password and provides visual feedback to the user.

3. Password Generation: Clicking the "Generate Password" button generates a random password based on the specified criteria and displays it in a text input field.
4. Password Copying: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
5. Password Strength Indicator: The website evaluates the strength of the generated password based on its length and displays a strength indicator with text and color-coded feedback.
